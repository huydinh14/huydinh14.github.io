        profile: "I am looking for an opportunity as a Full Stack Developer where I can use my programming language skills. In the backend, I have experience working with C#, .NET, and .NET Core. I have worked with many technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like ReactJs and NextJs. I believe that the ability to work on both sides of the application will help me contribute strongly to the development and maintenance of the system. At the same time, this flexibility also helps me grasp and apply new technologies quickly, increasing the team's adaptability."
